PHP interfaces and abstractions to help with separating your models from the rest of your application.

As this grows it may borrow some ideas from DDD but it isn't meant to be a true DDD solution. It's meant to provide something basic to separate models from the rest of the app while still benefitting from quick development.

**The APIs are moving as are branches, don't expect to use this yet.**

*This is a work in progress. Docs to come.*
