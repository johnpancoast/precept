PHP interfaces and abstractions to help with the domain layer.

This will contain things that are loosely based on a couple ideas from DDD but
it isn't meant to be a DDD solution. As I find things that are common for my
application's domain model that can be abstracted, they'll move here, however,
I sacrifice many ideas in DDD for speedier development.

*This is a work in progress. Docs to come.*
